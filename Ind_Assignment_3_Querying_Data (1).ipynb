    "# Individual Assignment 3 - Querying data\n",
    "In this assignment, students are going to focus on getting data out of a database, using a few different methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to understand how to get data out of a database using SQL queries directly, pandas and also directly into our objects using SQLAlchemy \n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "1. A PDF of this notebook OR a link to the repository where the final version of the notebook is store.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Relational databases are super helpful way to store data and settings for applications.  They are efficient at managing space, easy to maintain and provide an extra layer of security to the data. Being able to load and save data to a database from a program brings a great deal of flexibility to our ability to automate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "**BEFORE YOU BEGIN**, if you haven't forked/cloned this from github you will need to ensure that you also get the `chinook.db` and `laptopsales.db` file as well as the entire `images` folder and put these in the same directory as the notebook.  See below.  If you have forked/cloned this repository, everything you need is already in the right place.\n",

    "# Part 1 - Querying data using SQL commands\n",
    "Since you already know quite a bit about querying a SQL database, this is the easiest way to get data from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic steps are \n",
    "1. *Connect to the database*. This may require some setup work depending on database type (SQLite, MS SQL, Teradata, etc).  Often times an intermediate piece of software called a database driver is required. This piece of software knows how to make a connection to the database server and send your SQL commands to the database and return the results to you. For SQLite, the driver is built-into Python and so there is no extra software to setup other than the standard Python libraries.\n",
    "2. *Create a cursor* that can be used to send commands to the server. A database cursor is a pointer that moves around the database and points to the data you want to retrieve from the database.\n",
    "3. *Execute a command*. Once the setup has been completed, we can finally execute a command. A command is the SQL statement you want to be sent to the database.  If the command returns data (as in a SELECT statement), then the cursor will point to the data that is to be returned (but keep in mind, only 1 row of data at a time).\n",
    "\n",
    "The next cell shows the basics of creating a connection, establishing a cursor and executing a command to the database."

    "### Understanding Database Cursors and Data Fetching\n",
    "\n",
    "When you execute a SQL query, the database doesn't immediately return all the data. Instead, it returns a **cursor** object. Think of the cursor as a pointer that navigates through the result set returned by a query. The cursor starts before the first row of the result set, and you can think of it as being positioned \"above\" the first row initially.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cursor Movements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`fetchone()`**: When you call this method, the cursor moves down one row and returns that row's data. If you call `fetchone()` again, it will move down another row and return that row's data, and so on.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **`fetchmany(size)`**: Calling this moves the cursor down by `size` number of rows and returns those rows as a list. For example, if you call `fetchmany(3)`, the cursor moves down three rows and returns those three rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`fetchall()`**: This method moves the cursor to the end of the table, fetching all remaining rows and returning them as a list. Note that this could be memory-intensive for large result sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine your query returns a result set like this, where the arrow (`-->`) indicates the cursor's position:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    (Row 1)\n",
    "--> (Row 2)\n",
    "    (Row 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After calling `fetchmany(2)`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    (Row 1)\n",
    "    (Row 2)\n",
    "--> (Row 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After calling `fetchall()`:\n",

    "    (Row 3)\n",
    "--> (End)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Note\n",
    "- Once the cursor reaches the end, subsequent calls to `fetchone()` or `fetchmany()` will return an empty result. You would need to re-execute the query to reset the cursor position.\n",

    "# Part 3 - Using an SQLAlchemy (Object Relational Mapping)\n",
    "So far you have learned how to work with databases by querying directly, using dynamic queries and getting the data back in the form of a dataframe.  What would be super handy in some cases is to be able to map database objects directly onto Python objects. Being able to treat database tables like other Python objects is very valuable.  Expecting each row to be represented by a particular Python object allows us to access the columns as properties of the class and handles the insert/update/delete functions for us without having to depend on fragile SQL strings.  (Fragile SQL strings means that we are putting code logic into a string which isn't checked by Python before being run, so if there is a change in the database, we have to search through strings in our code to update the logic rather than being able to depend on refactoring tools provided by our IDEs.  *Are you glad you asked what 'fragile SQL strings' means?*)  The library most often used to do ORM (object relational mapping) is a library called SQLAlchemy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to our `chinook` dataset.  It would be helpful to be able to consider customers as Python objects, if we could query for them and then use the objects to build our front-end forms or maybe just export them to a semi-strucured file format like json or xml for transport.  We'll start with an example and then break it down.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: If you haven't installed [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) yet you are going to need to do so.  You can reference this site for the [installation guide](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/intro.html#installation).  Try not to get to mired in the details of the rest of the library just yet**"
